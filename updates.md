### This file is not intended for the user/developer. This is meant to capture my own notes on the possible improvements to the existing Harness developer content.

1. Fine-grained GitHub PAT over classic.
2. k3d.io over k3d.io/v5.5.1 which led to older version.
3. "Log in to Harness"; not "Login to Harness".
4. "For this tutorial, let's explore how to install a delegate using Helm." is in code block.
5. "Copy the command as shown in the installation wizard, which is of the format of the example mentioned below and run in your terminal." is redundant and can be removed.
6. A note to use the latest `delegateDockerImage`.
7. GitHub branch ~master~ to main.
8. Sample UTM link added for Harness account sign up for tracking and metrics.
9. Visual pipeline name should match. ~harness_guestbook_pipeline~ `guestbook_canary_pipeline`.
10. Zoom in on the pipeline for the image.
11. Add Harness key concepts as a pre-req.
