1. Fine-grained GitHub PAT over classic.
2. k3d.io over k3d.io/v5.5.1 which led to older version.
3. "Log in to Harness"; not "Login to Harness".
4. "For this tutorial, let's explore how to install a delegate using Helm." is in code block.
5. "Copy the command as shown in the installation wizard, which is of the format of the example mentioned below and run in your terminal." is redundant and can be removed.
6. A note to use the latest `delegateDockerImage`.
